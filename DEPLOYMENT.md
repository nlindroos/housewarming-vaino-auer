- âœ… Image optimization
- âœ… Static generation where possible

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

- Ensure Node.js version is 18+
- Run `npm install` before building
- Check for TypeScript errors with `npm run type-check`

### Deployment Issues

- Verify all environment variables are set
- Check build logs for errors
- Ensure repository is public (for free tiers)

### Performance Issues

- Images are automatically optimized by Next.js
- CSS is automatically purged by Tailwind
